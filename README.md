# Airflow_ETL_Pipeline - Airflow DAG for Data Processing

## Overview

This project defines an Airflow Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline. It utilizes Airflow to orchestrate the process of:

- Loading air pollution data from a specified URL to local storage.
- Cleaning and transforming the data.
- Validating the transformed data.
- Performing calculations and generating summary statistics.
- Storing the processed data in a database (currently uses PostgreSQL for demonstration).
- Visualizing the data.

This framework allows for scheduled data processing and analysis, ensuring data freshness and providing insights into air quality trends.

## Features

- Utilizes Airflow for scheduling and managing data processing tasks.
- Modular design with separate functions for each ETL step.
- Supports data cleaning, validation, transformation, and analysis.
- Integrates with a database for persistent data storage.
- Offers optional data visualization capabilities.

## Usage

- Configure Airflow according to your environment (web server, scheduler, database connection).
- Ensure the DAG definition file (air_pollution_etl.py) is placed in the Airflow DAGs directory.
- Trigger the DAG manually or through the Airflow web interface.

## Configuration

- The Airflow environment needs to be configured with relevant settings (web server, scheduler, database connection). 
- The DAG definition (air_pollution_etl) have configurable parameters like data source URL, database connection details, and local storage path.
